# text_extractor: Immediately capture text from a region of interest screenshot

Sequel to my [area-screenshot](https://github.com/oluminous/area-screenshot) project.

## Requirements
  - Python 3+
  - Packages in the ```requirements.txt``` file. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  
    On Linux, ```pyautogui``` has some extra dependencies. Simply run the following commands from the terminal to install them:
    ```sudo pip3 install python3-xlib```, 
    ```sudo apt-get install scrot```, 
    ```sudo apt-get install python3-tk```, and 
    ```sudo apt-get install python3-dev``` 
  
## How to Use
  1. Start the script: ```python extractor.py```
  2. As explained in [area-screenshot](https://github.com/oluminous/area-screenshot), click the edges of the intended screenshot.
  3. The text in the screenshot will be displayed on the terminal.
